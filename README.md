HMC Map App
===========

[Link to the actual map](http://ejtaal.net/hmc)

This app in the form of a HTML 5 website is designed primarily for
mobile phone users. It allows you to find the nearest HMC certified
outlet based on your location.

Upon loading the website will try to determine your location and find
the nearest restaurant/takeout as I believe this might be the most
common situation. The information of the nearest outlet will be shown
and you'll be able to click the telephone number to call and clicking
the address will bring up google maps which can give you directions.

TODO:
=====

- Add field to allow specifying location manually
- Add link to google to allow easy finding of online menu/meal2go/justeat website.
- Wrap this website in an app for android?
